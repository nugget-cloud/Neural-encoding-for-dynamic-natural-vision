Objective:

To design, develop, and validate a deep learning-based model that decodes and predicts the specific visual stimuli presented to individuals based on their intracranial electrocorticography (iEEG) recordings.

This project seeks:

Decoding Sensory Representations: To understand the intricate patterns of brain activity and uncover how different visual stimuli are neurally represented and processed in the human brain. This involves translating the high-dimensional iEEG data into discernible visual stimulus attributes.

Advanced Neural Model Development: To employ state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, leveraging the temporal precision and spatial resolution of iEEG data, aiming to achieve accurate stimulus predictions.

Insights into Neural Processing: Beyond mere prediction, the project aims to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms of sensory perception, potentially revealing the hierarchical and distributed nature of visual information processing in the cortex.

Enhanced Understanding of Brain Function: By successfully decoding visual stimuli from brain activity, the project can offer insights into how sensory information is encoded in neural circuits, enhancing our understanding of brain function, especially in the context of sensory perception.

Neural Code Decoding: Predicting Visual Stimuli from Brain Activity

This project aims to develop a deep learning model that predicts visual stimuli based on brain activity patterns. By decoding these neural patterns, we hope to gain insights into how the brain processes and represents sensory information.
Essential Technologies

    Python: The primary language for data processing and model implementation.
    TensorFlow/PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks for building and training neural network models.
    Scikit-learn: For traditional machine learning methods, data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.
    Nibabel: Python library for reading and writing neuroimaging data formats.
    BrainIAK: Advanced tools for fMRI analysis and sample datasets.
    LIME/SHAP: For model interpretability and understanding predictions.

Dataset

We will be using datasets from OpenNeuro, a platform hosting neuroimaging data. Specifically, we'll look for studies where participants viewed visual stimuli, and their brain activity was recorded using fMRI.

    Dataset Source: OpenNeuro

It's essential to familiarize yourself with the dataset structure, experimental design, and any preprocessing steps applied.
Basic Architecture

    Data Collection and Preprocessing:
        Download the dataset from OpenNeuro.
        Use Nibabel for data extraction.
        Apply noise filtering, temporal filtering, and spatial smoothing to clean the fMRI data.
        Align neural data with corresponding visual stimuli.

    Feature Engineering:
        Apply dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, if necessary.
        Extract relevant features or regions of interest from the fMRI data.

    Model Design:
        Create a deep neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
        Depending on the data's structure, consider architectures like CNNs (for 3D spatial data) or RNNs/LSTMs (for time series data).

    Training:
        Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
        Train the model using the training set, monitoring its performance on the validation set.
        Regularization techniques like dropout may be applied to prevent overfitting.

    Evaluation:
        Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, mean squared error, or others relevant to the problem.
        Apply model-agnostic interpretability tools like LIME or SHAP to understand model decisions on a per-sample basis.

    Deployment (Optional):
        Once satisfied with the model's performance, consider deploying it as a web service or integrating it into a larger system for real-time or batch predictions.
